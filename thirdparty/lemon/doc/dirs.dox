\dir contrib
\brief Directory for user contributed source codes.

You can place your own C++ code using LEMON into this directory, which
will compile to an executable along with LEMON when you build the
library. This is probably the easiest way of compiling short to medium
codes, for this does require neither a LEMON installed system-wide nor
adding several paths to the compiler.

Please have a look at <tt>contrib/CMakeLists.txt</tt> for
instruction on how to add your own files into the build process.  */
